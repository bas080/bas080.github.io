Once upon a time in Barcelona. A lonely man stares at a green wall. The TV is
on; an annoyed talkshow guest explains the unjust that has been done to him.
While gazing, the man is searching his mind for a battle that is his.
[Sisyphus][1] would agree.

The man recolects fondly the time when he was thaught [Draughts][2]. Opposite
of him sits his father. Relaxed in a white arm-chair, he gazes at the board
with a satisfied grin. His son looks at his father. He admires his calm and
devotion for the game. Every minute or so a move is made. The son, anxious to
inevitably lose, ecstatic, that his father is paying close attention him.

The boy aged, yet these memories did not fade. Unknowingly a love for
deterministic systems was cultevated in him. He was destined to embrace
programming.

He muted the TV, grabbed the laptop from the table and placed it on his lap.
Convinced that it would take a half a day, he started implementing a rule
checker for the game of Draughts.

Five years later.
