# My Bash utilities

[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) has become my go to
tool for interfacing with my computer. The main reason being that I'm able to
compose different tools easily and automate tasks I do or should do with
frequency. I use it for things like:

- Running tests on my projects. Also tests that aren't part of the project, but
  which I think are important to run.
  [Prove](https://perldoc.perl.org/prove.html) is a lovely tool for doing this.

- Simplify by standardizing the way I interface with different projects.

- Automate tasks that would otherwise require lot's of clicking and button
  pressing.

- Create tools that enforce a process and improve the quality of projects.

Command line tools allow you to extend them relatively easily compared to GUI
tools. I would like to share with you some of the "extensions" I have made to
improve my Bash experience.
