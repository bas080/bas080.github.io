# Minetest

You might have noticed that I have quite some Minetest mods hosted on
Github. They allow people to add features like tiny trees, a mailbox,
vines and different textures to their game. But why would I spend hours
of my time making these mods? Sometimes it's nice to work on code for
no particular reason.

Play is something people do all the time. I happen to code and share that work
with people. Why do I play?. I'm not able to answer that question. It just
feels like something I should be doing. For me it's the most constructive way
to distract myself.
